**Coding for Good App Badge VIRTUAL Event**

Repo contains the files that supported the 2020 May/June GSOC Coding for Good App Badge Event.

There were two email lists called EventMailerList.csv (main list for weekly updates) and EventMailingList_DidNotSubmitProject.csv (list of the girls that did not submit their work during the course of the event).  Both of these lists have been encrypted before storing on this repo.

The mailer.py program was used to send bi-weekly email notifications.  The file emailcredentials.ini was excluded from this repo.

The TEMPLATES folder contains the list of communications, a pair of files for each communication (.html/.txt).

Notes regarding the structure of this event:

This virtual event was held over a 5-week period.  Week one consisted of a "kick-off" Zoom meeting (GSOC hosted the Zoom meetings) during which we shared the CodingForGoodLaunchVideo.mp4 and talked about the structure of the event.

**Structure:**
Immediately after the "kick-off" Zoom meeting, the Part 1 Video invitation email was sent, containing a link to the Part 1 video and instructions on how to submit work along with any supporting links required.  The instructions were included both with the Part 1 Video invitation email as well as the Description of the YouTube video.  The instructions included the list of "graphical assets" included within the project provided for remixing: GRAPHIC_ASSETS_CodingForGoodAppDev2020.pdf.  The pre-started Thunkable project for remixing was: https://x.thunkable.com/copy/61091b8c7ed8c0facf901b43f6cfb8d9.

On Thursdays of each week, a reminder email was sent reminding girls to submit their work via the event's Google Form created for this purpose: https://forms.gle/rtjPDGDCpbR2jtct5.  Submitting amounts to creating a shared link from within Thunkable and pasting it into the Google Form (https://forms.gle/rtjPDGDCpbR2jtct5).

On Sundays we had an hour long Zoom meeting to take on any unsupported questions, to talk about the next part, and to share a few new Thunkable tricks.  Our Part 1 Zoom meeting recapped the importance of design and layouts, and we introduce the discussion of creating a design using a paper prototype that fits within the event's DESIGN OBJECTIVES which we share here: DESIGN_OBJECTIVES_CodingForGoodAppDev2020.pdf.   The template for PaperPrototyping (along with the other two PDFs much above) are included within this reop.

The process above repeated for the following two weeks (Part 2, Part 3), meaning we released the Partn video email immediately after the Sunday Zoom meeting, sent the reminder email on Thursday and held a follow up Zoom meeting on Sunday.  Part 4's weekly meeting was really just a CELEBRATION.  A video was created for the event consisting of some of the girl's designs and a few videos showing screen navigation and functionality.
