GSOC Coding for Good - App Development

Hi {CONTACT}:
Thank you again for participating in the Coding for Good - App Development virtual badge earning event!

I hope you enjoyed the Part 1 video, and that you have created your very first "Hello World" single screen phone app! Woo Hoo!

Just a few REMINDERS:

* As presented at the end of the Part 1 video, DON'T FORGET TO SHARE YOUR WORK FOR CHECKING using the GOOGLE FORM we have provided for this purpose.  A big thank you to the girls that have already submitted their project links!

     We'd like you to submit your work BEFORE THE END OF DAY FRIDAY so our STEM Patrol Volunteers have time to check it in advance of Sunday's Zoom meeting.

     The Google Form link is here: https://forms.gle/rtjPDGDCpbR2jtct5 

* About that Sunday May 31st Zoom meeting from 4p - 5p. Please attend if you had questions regarding Part 1, if you'd like to learn a few extra Thunkable tricks, or if you'd just like to chat about your app!
