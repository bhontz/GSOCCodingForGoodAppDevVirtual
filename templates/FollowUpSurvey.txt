GSOC Coding for Good - App Development - FOLLOW UP SURVEY

Hi {{CONTACT}}:
Thank you once again for being part of our Coding for Good - App Development badge earning event!  We enjoyed having you participate and hope that you enjoyed learning about mobile app development and design.

As the GSOC may be required to hold virtual events for some time in the future, it's likely that we will offer this same badge earning event later this year.  You could help us improve this event for your fellow Girl Scouts by providing your feedback via this brief event survey (click on the link below):

You feedback is important, kindly complete our Post-Event Survey!  https://forms.gle/wcQTwqCnNcLpR9MT6

We have some more Thunkable for you!

Completing the survey will "unlock" a link to a BONUS VIDEO.  The bonus video will show the underlying detail of the "Thunkable Tips" that we shared during our Sunday afternoon Zoom meetings.

Interest in learning more about GSOC app development challenge teams?

Thank you to the girls that have expressed an interest in forming GSOC app challenge teams.  We're creating a list of girls with interest in forming Girl Scouts of Orange County teams to enter the Technovation Girls and Congressional App Challenges.  If you have an interest, kindly reply to this email in order to be invited to an upcoming parent info event.  Please note that girls must be in Jr. High or High School this fall in order to enter next year's app challenges.

On behalf of the GSOC Volunteer STEM Patrol, I want to thank you once again for registering for this event.  The STEM Patrol is looking forward to providing you with many more fun STEM opportunities in the future.
