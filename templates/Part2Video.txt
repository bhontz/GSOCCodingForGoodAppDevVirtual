GSOC Coding for Good - App Development - PART 2 VIDEO

Hi {{CONTACT}}:
Welcome back to Part 2 of the Coding for Good App Development virtual badge earning event!

In Part 1, we started exploring the Thunkable app development environment by creating our very first "Hello World" app!  Along the way, we talked about the importance and roll of LAYOUT (or "containers") in our app designs.

This week, we'll talk about the app development process, present our app DESIGN OBJECTIVES, and talk about PAPER PROTOTYPING.  Your assignment for the week is to create a paper prototype of your own app design, or you can simply replicate the design we will be presenting as our example within the Part 2 video.

At the end of the Part 2 video, we'll show you how to use your phone to take a picture of your paper prototype, so you can share your paper prototype on the weekly GOOGLE FORM.  Links for the paper prototyping template as well as the GOOGLE FORM will be provided within the comments section of the Part 2 YouTube video.  If you're having difficulting displaying the comments beneath the video: (1) click on the SORT BY link found beneath the video (in the comments area).  (2) select NEWEST FIRST from the subsequent menu.  That should expose the comments.

This week's video is available here:
