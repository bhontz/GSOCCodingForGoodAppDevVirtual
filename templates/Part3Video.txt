GSOC Coding for Good - App Development - PART 3 VIDEO

Hi {{CONTACT}}:
Welcome back to Part 3 of the Coding for Good App Development virtual badge earning event!

Now the FUN begins!  In Part 1 we learned how to get started with Thunkable.  In Part 2, we created our own app design using Paper Prototyping.  Now in Part 3, we'll go back into Thunkable and create our app design!  Get ready to start coding too - we'll need to make those buttons you created do something when you click on them!

The STEM Patrol volunteers are really looking forward to reviewing the cool apps you create in Part 3!  Just like we did in Part 1, before the end of the day Friday, we ask that you submit your Thunkable project using the Google Form (https://forms.gle/rtjPDGDCpbR2jtct5) we created for this event.  Remember, its ok if you just want to follow along with the Part 3 video and create the same app we will show in the Part 3 video.  You might want to allow more time for this week's work; the Part 3 video is a little longer, and it may take you a bit longer to complete your Part 3 work this week.  Be prepared!
This week's video is available here:
