GSOC Coding for Good - App Development - LET'S CELEBRATE!

Hi {{CONTACT}}:
Congratulations on the completion the Coding for Good - App Development badge earning event, you've earned your badge - so let's CELEBRATE THIS SATURDAY!

I hope you enjoyed the Part 4 video and were able to add a BAR GRAPHIC to your app this week. 

Just a few REMINDERS:

DON'T FORGET TO SHARE YOUR PROJECT FOR CHECKING using the GOOGLE FORM we have provided for this purpose.  A big thank you to the girls that have already submitted their PART 4 project work!.  NOTE: If you have forgotten how to share your project link within the GOOGLE FORM, please review the end of the PART 1 video (https://youtu.be/u-kK_BzZWyo) for instruction.
We'd like you to submit your project work BEFORE THE END OF DAY FRIDAY so our STEM Patrol Volunteers have time to check it in advance of Saturday's Zoom meeting.

The Google Form link is here: https://forms.gle/rtjPDGDCpbR2jtct5

SCHEDULE CHANGE - OUR FINAL CELEBRATORY ZOOM MEETING IS THIS SATURDAY June 20th from 4p - 5p.  I hope you will all attend and celebrate your achievement with us!

SHARE YOUR APP WITH US THIS SATURDAY!  We're looking for a few girls that are excited to talk about their app design and would be willing to share their app with the group during this Saturday's Zoom meeting.  As some point during the meeting, we will ask girls to copy and paste their Thunkable Project Link (same link you have been copy and pasting into the event Google Form) into the Zoom meeting Chat window.  Our instructor will then load the project on a shared screen and ask you to talk a bit about it!

If you have taken time to review the GLOBAL GOALS we sent within our Part 4 video email, we'll try to set aside some time to talk about app ideas that can benefit others, and app challenges we can enter as Girl Scout teams to create these beneficial apps.  Let's help make the world a better place!

This SATURDAY's (Jun 20th 4p-5p) ZOOM Meeting is:
