GSOC Coding for Good - App Development

Hi {{CONTACT}}:
Thank you again for participating in the Coding for Good - App Development virtual badge earning event!

This was a busy week for this event, I hope you enjoyed the work and that your app now has (at least) two working buttons!

Just a few REMINDERS:

DON'T FORGET TO SHARE YOUR PROJECT FOR CHECKING using the GOOGLE FORM we have provided for this purpose.  A big thank you to the girls that have already submitted their PART 3 project work!.  NOTE: If you have forgotten how to share your project link within the GOOGLE FORM, please review the end of the PART 1 video (https://youtu.be/u-kK_BzZWyo) for instruction.
We'd like you to submit your project work BEFORE THE END OF DAY FRIDAY so our STEM Patrol Volunteers have time to check it in advance of Sunday's Zoom meeting.

The Google Form link is here: https://forms.gle/rtjPDGDCpbR2jtct5

About that Sunday June 14th Zoom meeting from 4p - 5p.  Please attend if you had questions regarding Part 3, if you'd like to learn a few extra new Thunkable tricks, or if you'd just like to chat about your cool app design!

This Sunday's (June 14th 4p-5p) ZOOM Meeting is:
