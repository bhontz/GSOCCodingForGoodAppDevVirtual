GSOC Coding for Good - App Development - PART 4 VIDEO

Hi {{CONTACT}}:
Congratulations {{CONTACT}}, we made it across the finish line!  WOO HOO!!  This is the FINAL video and opportunity for you to earn your Coding For Good App Development badge, congratulations to you!  If you have been falling a little behind, NO PROBLEM, spend this week catching up!

In this final part, we will add a COOKIE SALES graphic to our now nearly complete apps in order to fulfill one of the badge requirement steps.  Among the links provided below (and as well within the YouTube video comments and description) you will find a link to a Google Sheet containing Girl Scout Cookie Sales data.  Unfortunately, this sheet contains data only for the girls that sold more than 300 boxes of cookies during the 2020 Cookie Season.  Within the Part 4 video, we will show you how to "parse" the cookie sales data from this google sheet into a format that can be used to form the bar chart within our app.

The STEM Patrol volunteers are really looking forward to reviewing your COMPLETED APP!  Just like we did in Part 1, before the end of the day Friday, we ask that you submit your Thunkable project using the Google Form (https://forms.gle/rtjPDGDCpbR2jtct5) we created for this event.
CELEBRATION EVENT NEXT SATURDAY 4-5p!  Please plan on attending our CELEBRATION ZOOM MEETING EVENT next Saturday from 4p - 5p.  The ZOOM meeting details can be found at the end of this email message.  {{CONTACT}} if you are interested in SHARING your app during Saturday's Zoom meeting, please be prepared to CUT & PASTE the link to your app into the COMMENTS section of the Zoom meeting.  We'll also talk about how you could enter APP CHALLENGES were you can work with a team of your fellow GSOC Girl Scouts to build an app that would address a problem that you experience in your neighborhood, school or society in general.  Please look over the GLOBAL CHALLENGES link provided below, and we would LOVE to hear any APP IDEAS you'd like to share during this Saturday's celebratory Zoom meeting!
