GSOC Coding for Good - App Development - YOUR FEEDBACK IS IMPORTANT!

Hi {{CONTACT}}:
Just a quick FOLLOW UP to our recently completed four part Coding for Good App Development Badge Earning event.  We noticed that you did not submit project work during the course of the event.

We will likely repeat this event in the fall, and we'd WELCOME YOUR FEEDBACK to help us improve.  In particular, if for some reason you were NOT ABLE to fully complete this event, kindly REPLY TO THIS EMAIL and share WHY so you can help us make changes for the better!

Thank you in advance for your kind assistance,
