GSOC Coding for Good - App Development

Hi {{CONTACT}}:
Thank you again for participating in the Coding for Good - App Development virtual badge earning event!

I hope you enjoyed the Part2 video, and that you've enjoyed designing your app!  Looking forward to reviewing your PAPER PROTOTYPE design!

Just a few REMINDERS:

As presented at the end of the Part 2 video, DON'T FORGET TO SHARE YOUR PAPER PROTOTYPE FOR CHECKING using the GOOGLE FORM we have provided for this purpose.  A big thank you to the girls that have already submitted their PART 2 paper prototypes!

We'd like you to submit your paper prototypes BEFORE THE END OF DAY FRIDAY so our STEM Patrol Volunteers have time to check it in advance of Sunday's Zoom meeting.

The Google Form link is here: https://forms.gle/rtjPDGDCpbR2jtct5

About that Sunday June 7th Zoom meeting from 4p - 5p.  Please attend if you had questions regarding Part 2, if you'd like to learn a few extra Thunkable tricks, or if you'd just like to chat about your cool app design!
